I am a software engineer, currently working as the principal engineer over at [Junum](https://junum.io).

My preferred programming language is the one that solves the problem at hand, but recently I've really enjoyed [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/). Check it out if you're unfamiliar! For web stuff it's best paired with a glass of the [Pheonix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/), but is a natural and fun feeling functional language on it's own. Perhaps some code examples to come; either here or on my Github.

I'm comfortable on most web stacks (LAMP, MEAN, Java+Spring, etc), have extensive experience building out data warehouses and analytics features, and have strong opinions on DevOps: from application reliability to developer happiness
