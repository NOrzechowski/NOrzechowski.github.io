I am a software engineer, currently working as the principal engineer over at [Junum](https://junum.io). I excel at managing complex technical projects and working with people.
My preferred programming language is the one that solves the problem at hand, but with that said I have experience in Java, Python, JS, Elixir and some .NET exposure.
